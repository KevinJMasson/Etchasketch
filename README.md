<h1>Etch-a-sketch</h1>
This is my javascript practice of the Odin Project's etch-a-sketch project. This project aims to practice the DOM manipulation of adding and removing objects, and handling event listeners to create a cohesive app.

<h2>Goal</h2>
Implement a functional Etch-a-sketch using Javascript in which a user can draw on the grid by mousing over the drawing space;

<h2>Implementation</h2>
I completed this using event listeners to all squares created on the grid, which turns the style of the square into a black background, simulating a drawn pixel

<h2>Improvements that can be made</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Change events tracked into seeing if the mouse is current held down, so that you aren't forced to draw from the border</li>
  <li>Stop the user from creating grids big enough to slow down the browser (e.g. if the user inputs 960, the size of the grid, the browser has to create 900 000+ divs which slows the browser down</li>
</ul>
